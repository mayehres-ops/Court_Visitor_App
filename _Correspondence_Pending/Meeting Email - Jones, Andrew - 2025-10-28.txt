SUBJECT: Court Visitor meeting for Andrew Jones (Travis County)

Hello Andrew P. Jones,

I’ve been assigned by the Travis County Probate Court as a Court Visitor for Andrew Jones. Court Visitors meet wards where they live to confirm their needs are being met. You can read more about the program here: https://www.traviscountytx.gov/probate/court-vistor.

I would like to schedule a visit next week and I’m holding Wed, Thu as first options. You’re welcome to attend (not required). If you can’t attend, a brief phone call beforehand works fine.

A few quick items to reply with:
1) Which day/time works best (Wed/Thu), and who (if anyone) will be present.
2) Exact address of the ward’s residence (street number, city).
3) Any entry instructions—for example, gated community or private gate codes, buzzer instructions, or special directions if the house number is hard to see. Landmarks or parking tips are very helpful. Please also let me know if there are protective pets that should be secured.

Thank you in advance for your time and help. I look forward to meeting you and the ward.

Warm regards,
May Ehresman
Court Visitor (Travis County)
