SUBJECT: Court Visit — Hall, Alexandra — Cause 08-088136

Dear Guardian,

I’m looking forward to getting to know Alexandra Hall and speaking with you.

When: November 6, 2025 at 3:00 PM (about 60 minutes)
Where: 2. Prestonwood Circle, Lakeway, TX 78734 [map: https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=2.+Prestonwood+Circle%2C+Lakeway%2C+TX+78734]

Quick logistics so I arrive without surprises:
- If you’re in a gated community or have a gated home, how should I get in?
- If the home doesn’t have a visible house number, what should I look for?
- If parking is tight, where’s the best place to park?

I often have several visits back-to-back. I aim to be right on time, but if I’m more than 15 minutes early or late, I’ll call you—unless I’m actively driving and can’t call safely.

Optional (zero pressure): This short pre-visit questionnaire covers many of the topics I usually ask about. It’s completely optional—if you’re pressed for time or prefer to discuss at the visit, that’s absolutely fine. It can save a few minutes if you do have time.

If you need to reschedule, you can reply to this email, text me at 317-339-9963, or call. (Text is best.)

Thank you—looking forward to meeting you and Alexandra.

May Ehresman
