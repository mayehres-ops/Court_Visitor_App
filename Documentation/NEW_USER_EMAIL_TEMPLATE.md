**Subject:** Court Visitor App - Registration Required

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Welcome to the Court Visitor App!

Before you can download and use the app, I need to register your Google account in our system.

**Please reply to this email with:**
- Your full name
- Your Gmail address (the one you'll use with the app)

Once I receive your information, I'll add you to the authorized users list (takes about 1 business day), and then I'll send you the download link and instructions.

**Why is this needed?**
The app uses Google APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Sheets) and must be authorized by Google. By adding you as an authorized user, you won't need to re-authorize the app every week.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
GuardianShip Easy, LLC
